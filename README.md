# High level exploration of US births data

This is a fairly small project in which I've used Jupyter Notebook to conduct some preliminary analysis of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) US births data from 1994 - 2003.

## Files

| File name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [births.csv](births.csv) | csv file with the 1994-2003 US births data from CDC |
| [births.ipynb](births.ipynb) | Jupyter Notebook with the mini analysis |
| [environment.yml](environment.yml) | Conda environment required to run this code |

## Setup

- You must have [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) installed to run this code.
- Create a conda environment using [environment.yml](environment.yml) YAML file. More help on this can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html#use-environment-from-file).
